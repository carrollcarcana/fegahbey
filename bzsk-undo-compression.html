So after having numerous shops tell me I need new upper control arms (worn bushings) I set aside my Saturday to get them in. After finicking around a bit I figure out how to go about getting the old one off and take apart the linkage attaching it to the wheel hub/brake assembly, set a jack under the lower arm, and start loosening the upper strut mounts. I get all 3 out along with the center nut and then loosen the bottom bolt and the fucking thing shoots downwards causing the wheel assembly. How do I undo compression of my disks in Windows 10?:I have by mistake compressed my disk and I want to undo it.

I have a simple sprite sheet download (115x1800, Windows 7 shows 26.5kB as file size). When I open it in GIMP, GIMP shows me already when viewing a file size of 2.2 mB. After saving, GIMP AND Windows show me 2.2 MB as file size. I'm not a graphic designer and know almost nothing about image formats. Could someone explain to me what is going on and how I save best a sprite sheet with transparency and small size? Edit: Edited.

Hi all, I've been using emacs for over a year now and I started off with a vanilla emacs configuration that I wanted to build myself. I'm mainly a Haskell programmer and tooling is great for emacs. I've also been in love with this editor: the sheer amount of power and versatility at your fingertips is great. amp#x200B; However, over time, I seem to have accrued a lot of "modes", many of which don't make sense.

I never measured myself until recently, always just judged based on what I look like to myself. I’m overweight, have a wild bush, and am a grower. so I never thought of myself as big.

Hey everybody, So I’m really new to the music production scene, I’ve just loved EDM (Monstercat, for example) for as long as I can remember - and I have been playing music for the past 11 years or so (classical piano).

Critical gzip mistake (HELP!) - how to undo 'gzip -r /' Ask Question 6. 2.

Since then I spent countless ours to bring forth the idea of a versioned storage system, especially well suited for analytical tasks for time-varying data. Windows File Compression automatically compresses files so that they take up less space. In the best of circumstances it can free up a lot of space, but all too frequently it's not as much as you might expect, and there no screenshots this time, for there would be too many, but i wrote up some more help files on stillborn's medical system and felt like sharing them to highlight these systems more. amp#x200B; gtHelp on healing: gt gt\---------------------------------- gt gtBandages, injections, and sutures are all important to the healing process, but to understand recuperation requires understanding how one most easily lets their body do its work. gt gt gt gtThe most immedi. Three months and not a single nights sleep. Is that even a possible feat? The record has been 11 days and 25 minutes for decades, held to this day by Randy Gardner, but sleep is not simply the act of falling unconscious at night. Sleep is so much more. Our brains spend nighttime going through several cycles. Arguably the most important one being REM sleep, which is when we experience dreams. Whether they are memorable or not; They are necessary. Without REM, our minds will slowly Hello, I'm working on a time lapse project that involves stitching 21K files ( \~47gb. Files are JPEG's totaling roughly 2.3mb/file). amp#x200B; My initial attempt used the (mostly default) settings for libx264, and resulted in a 2gb file (although with some compression artifacts). I then decided to try redoing it in a lossless way, since I'm not overly sensitive to processing time or file size.

I'm sharing a weird quirk in Waifu2x that has been a large problem in my program, i.e bleeding, and how it was solved. The way convolution works is by applying a kernel filter to an image. While good for most cases in Waifu2x (and CNN's in general), it posed a pretty big issue in my program. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)) However, given two discrete blocks of pixels, it seems the kernel would very much impact the boarders of another block, i.e bleeding Example:.

Hey ya'll\~ amp#x200B; Yesterday, my wife and I, along with another couple we ride with, were riding West on Route 24 from Colorado Springs, Colorado towards Lake George. A few sport bike riders came up behind us, and we were stuck behind a relatively slow moving pickup.

I think almost every girl has a thing for a man in uniform. Firefighter, cop, military, paramedic, nurse, doctor. it just always got me fired up. So for a brief moment I worked in the ER of a local hospital reading EKGs for doctors. Not quite an emt or a nurse, more of like a extra educated cna. Myself and this other emt who worked on an ambulance always flirted with each other when he would bring in a patient.

Ganz ehrlich, das habe ich noch nicht gesehen. Haben deine Dateien Ordner denn einen blauen Pfeil im…. I understand the reasons why people have separate masters for CD and streaming, and I see the benefits, but I'd rather have one master for everything so there aren't multiple 'versions' of the same song (something that really bugs me in an irrational way). Will a normalized to just-below-zero master have negative processing applied to it on streaming services (such as further compression) or do they just straight up normalize it? What I've done in the mastering process is mastered
