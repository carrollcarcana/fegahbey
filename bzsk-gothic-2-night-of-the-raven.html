                            <p> Hey, guys. amp#x200B; Is there someone who tried to play Gothic 2: Night of the Raven (Steam Version) on Linux with Steam Play? I played a little bit and I can say that the FPS in the game is critically low. Everything is fine in the beginning, but then it becomes uncomfortable to play. I tried almost everything. Maybe some of you know what's up. amp#x200B; Я знаю, что тут также обитают русскоговорящие игроки. может поможете. Jeszcze większy, jeszcze trudniejszy! Zapraszam do rozwiązywania i komentowania. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxz5A\_fri3eRhx19YS6txmRuKm9fl9ZVD5dn6kVoZ5NFQIzw/viewform?usp=sf\_link (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxz5A_fri3eRhx19YS6txmRuKm9fl9ZVD5dn6kVoZ5NFQIzw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Hi guys, I made a short trivia test about Gothic 2. I tried to make it the hardest I could, but without resorting to some "how much damage a rusty sword deals" type of questions. Any feedback would be very appreciated. PM me, if you have any ideas for questions in part 2. Here's the test: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKotM2oE32inwycBhjw5PvFfT9zIeiw9eGzslPDy0rfpVmaQ/viewform?usp=sf\_link (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfKotM2oE32inwycBhjw5PvFfT9zIeiw9eGzslPDy0rfpVmaQ/vie. Snorting Dragon Snapper Requirements: any bow (his armour is too high either way), at least 200 arrows (in case you miss, and you DON'T want your arrows tu run out); IMPORTANT: DO NOT TALK TO GAAN. 1. There is an Innos statue near the small lake. Practise jumping on it. 2. Attack Snorter with a fire arrow from far away, let him chase you - run up and jump on the statue. 3. Grab a bow and shoot him. 4. Be careful, as you move backwards few milimeters with every shot. Remember to correct. Hi there, before i even start. Yes i know Forsen didnt play gothic yet but i will get to that later on. So i was thinking about this idea for a very long time, the ultimate AAA RPG mid for G2:NK based on our dear community. Full of songs, memes, real characters and with "profesional" voice acting. I wont talk about main story cuz this is just idea so for but probably this will be a story about exploring twitch land as someone, probably newfag. I dont wanna make another 
Hey guys I am playing right now Gothic 2 with L'Hiver and DX11. It looks stunningly beautiful. Although it is a very hard version of gothic, but I love nonetheless. Here is the thing. The L'Hiver addon adds armor crafting skill. And there is an armor that requires 4 lumps of black ore. Unfortunately, I found only 3. And I can't find a list or a map of locations, where black ore can be found. Maybe you could Hello! I am looking for a games similar to Gothic series, where you explore mystic temples. I really enjoyed it in Gothic 1 - Gothic 2: NotR. Other game with sth more/less similar was Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth. It might be FPS/RPG/Adventure game but I prefer rpg if possible. Also question about The Solus Project. Does it share similar theme I guess I can say that I am a preety good Gothic 2 player. Tho I have never really played the add on. This is because of the really hight strength you need to use weapons :D how do I play the addon because my usual playstyle doesn't really work anymore haha. I'd like some advise or a small guide. Greetings everyone It is nice to see that the old Gothic games are still alive and kicking. Also, to see active forums are very delightful. But I need help with the settings of all these mods. What I mean, my gothic game is very dark. At day, with clear weather it is bearable. But when its raining, I see only a few meters around. And dont get me started about what happens at night. Blindness and rape. Thats what happens at night. And I am on the receiving end, mind you. I learned Hello guys, I have a problem with Gothic 2 Night of the Raven. The problem started when Raven entered the doors in bandit's camp. The cutscene started and then the quest said that I have to go to the Saturas to tell him about it. But when I'm speaking to Saturas, nothing happens, there is no dialog option for that thing. I can only end a conversation with him. I don't Hello, amp#x200B; I've been reading trought this forum since Anthem got released. I need to apologize for my english in the first place as it;s not my native language. Im near 30, played since I was like 10-12 years old. Gone trough exciting titles like Gothic II, Night of the raven up to shit titles that im not going to mention, because well. there forgotten. amp#x200B; I must admit that I've played many mmo's (Wow, Dester Online, Lineage 2, Mu online, Guild wars 2) and looters. 
I've bought the gothic II gold edition on steam. I'm not a huge fan of the difficulty. Would like to play the original game because The Gothic series by Piranha Bytes (Gothic, Gothic II: Night of the Raven, Gothic III). It features hilarious and rough dialogue throughout and a lot of potential for sillyness as well. https://youtu.be/rRjNsWFetRo (https://youtu.be/rRjNsWFetRo) And then there's Enderal, an RPG using Skyrim as its engine. A fan project inspired by Gothic but with a much more sophisticated and very philosophical story, psychological horror elements included. https://youtu.be/VnracFjiC\_k (https://youtu.be/Vn. I am trying to clear the whole map in the very first chapter of Gothic and I have a few questions. I am using the Old Battle Axe which I found somewhere on the ground and I have a Shadow's Armour which I bought from Diego. I also have 100 strength. 1. https://i.imgur.com/MQhN6UE.jpg - I am having difficulties with killing all the skeletons in this dungeon, normally i would lure some of them outside and kill them but in this dungeon I always aggro all of them which makes it impossible I started playing Gothic 2 Night of the Raven once again, for 20th time or more. Please, I need to stop, I have exams this month. 
Hey there again. Recently today I finished the first Gothic game and while the ending was a huge let-down everything before it was so great that I immediately want to hop into the next one. But this time around the installation process isn't as clear. Way back when I bought the Gothic collection on Gamer s gate and for some reason Gothic 2 comes in two parts, the original game and the add-on instead of the Gold version. So here is where the confusion starts. Where am I supposed to install. Hi guys. First of all, I know they said there won't be DLCs. However, I've thought a lot about that statement over the last couple of days since finishing the game and I'm at a point where I think it simply makes no sense not to have a DLC/Addon. First of all, the story has (at least) two major loose ends (in addition to the main story obviously): 1. Wardek This guy, the protagonists 'father' and kind of the 'real bad guy', flees. The game ends with him being on the run which makes. Hello, I've been a gamer since pretty much i've been able to hold a controller on my little hands, and provided that I was born in 87, that has been quite a while. I've had the pleasure to play games even older than me, and here is my long list of games i've played until completition (many of them 100% even) (about 304 games, so far). You can talk to me about any of them and i will answer back, ask me for advice on a particular game, or even ask me for a short review. Lets get the conversation. Hey guys, alot of people here were looking for tips for games, mostly RPG's that are like Gothic. While Gothic is really unique game, I think it could be good idea to post here your list of top 5 games of all time, or top 5 rpg games (its the same for me), so people would see what other gothic fans like to play and maybe try some games themselves. As for me, the list is following: 5. Mount and Blade (Vanilla) 4. Risen (only the first one) 3. Mount and Blade: Warband 2. Dragon Age: Origins. Hello there, traveler. Here are some (unwanted) bugs commonly occurring in Gothic 2 Night of the Raven v. 2.6. I added some solutions or guides how to steer clear of them. Feel free to ask any questions, correct me or add new bugs to solve or solutions to find bugs for them. I also included some problems that people WERE THINKING they were bugs. 0) Weird bug, equipping ring increases stats PROBLEM When I equip and dequip ring or belt I get permanent increase in strength/dexterity. So the problem is that I'm trying to find a way to apply some minor adjustments to my Gothic 2: Night of the Raven. Like, change how much LP it costs to learn particular skill or make gaining strenth/dexterity/mana always cost 1 LP for 1 point. I'm a complete noob when it comes to modding. It seems like most mods/modding articles are avaible on german sites. Well, I'm not even a native english speaker and can't speak german at all. So I need someone to point me the right direction. It's super cheap right now and it's sounds pretty interesting. For a background, the RPGs I've enjoyed the most recently have been Skyrim, Morrowind, Gothic II:Night of the Raven and Gothic III. Opinions. I wasn't able to find a clean table for these questions so I recreated it here. Just copy into your favorite spreadsheet editor and hide the answer column to test yourself! EDIT: It doesn't actually paste cleanly into Excel so here is a csv to download (https://wetransfer.com/downloads/79c30b9c6d4f24a9112de937f9f043d120190503205819/db20bb) for those interested. amp#x200B; 2012 Rank Question Answer Correct :- :- :- :- 1 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE HORSE-LIKE ANIMAL WITH BLACK AND WHITE.
