It's that time of every two weeks again, and this week we're heading over to Vendetta in North Portland. Vendetta is a sweet spot with solid alcohol selections and some really nice plants. They also have games and an out-back patio, but we'll probably be hanging out in the area to the right of the entrance. We'll have Snoo Signs with us of course, so look for those, or find me, the short, curly-haired kid. See you there! Details below, including the FB event if you'd UPDATE: We're immediately to the right when you walk in, I'm wearing a grey hoodie and a scarf with words on them. obligatory "time of every two weeks" joke Wooo, I dunno about you folk, but I have some bones to pick with the world, and Vendetta seems like a perfectly named place for drinking them away. They've got pretty solid drink pricing, shuffleboard, and I think a couple pinball tables. We'll have reddit signs on our tables and if you're lost, you can look for me, the short Vaulted, Rares and Exclusive Pop sale! Only looking for Bloody Chase Leatherface or DJ Sona Concussion.

There's 2 copies of each. The better of each, I'm asking for . And the ones that are more banged up I'd like . Please see pics for the exact condition. None of them really look too bad. The better copy of V for Vendetta has no visible damage and appears to be in excellent condition. Both Graysons the plastic appears to be a little loose on. And the others are somewhere in between.

Hello all! I hope to bring a new colorway to the hobby, specifically geared towards 40%, 50%, and Ortholinear users. About Ortho users and specifically 40% staggered users miss out on tons of great keysets due to crazy MOQs for a few additional keys. (Note I'm not blaming designers specifically and I understand with GMK sets the MOQs are really high to begin with.) I thought I'd try and change it up a little bit with some inspiration from other users who have recently put forth # Big Duel! Paladin amp#x200B; I published my first Big Paladin decklist few days after the release on hearthpwn (https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1262146-mysterious-big-paladin) and since then I tried to fine tune it. My first list brought me from rank 10 to rank5 with 23-3 stats which felt insane to me even though hsreplay only showed Mech or Secret Paladin as a "viable" paladin theme and nobody seemed to experiment with Duel!-Paladin. Since rank5 I had to make several changes depending. I’m back! It took far longer than anticipated for my wounds to heal. For that, I apologize deeply. Many of you have suggested a “mundane” series and while I find nothing about this job to be mundane, I fully understand that you folks would rather me keep the family drama to a minimum. I will be doing just that henceforth with this particular log of events. Plus, Wade didn’t actually die, he just body jumped after we set him on fire. The abandoned mortuary makes way more sense now. Apparently Detective pikachu currently sits with a 71% approval on Rottentomatoes. Below is a list of the top 5 best-rated games adapted according to Rotten: 1. RAMPAGE - 53% 2. TOMB RAIDER - 51% 3. FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN - 45% 4. THE ANGRY BIRDS MOVIE - 43% 5. RESIDENT EVIL: VENDETTA - 43% It is also worth noting that Detective Pikachu is the best rated movie of the Pokémon franchise. Overcoming the movies; 1. Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!

Hi All, As part of my ongoing obsession with Druids, I have compiled a fat list of plot hooks. Some are vague, some are specific. I hope you find some use for them! --- Thanks to Gollicking Members, /u/M0rdenkainen, /u/InfinityCircuit, /u/Mimir-ion, /u/RexiconJesse for some ideas! --- Note : There are archetypes listed in some of the hooks (Avenger, Guardian, etc.) - the details on those are found at the bottom of the post. --- 1. A prey species is nearly extinct. 2. A predator. Detective pikachu currently sits with a 71% approval on Rottentomatoes. Below is a list of the top 5 best-rated games adapted according to Rotten: 1.
